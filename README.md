# COMS W4762 — Assignment 1: Regularized Linear Regression

This notebook implements **linear regression with L2 (Ridge) and L1 (Lasso) regularization from scratch**. It walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and plotting to illustrate the effect of regularization and the bias–variance trade-off.

## What it does
- Loads/preprocesses a dataset for supervised learning.
- Implements linear regression with **Ridge (L2)** and **Lasso (L1)** penalties.
- Trains models, tunes regularization strength, and compares against unregularized regression.
- Evaluates performance with common metrics and visualizes results.

## Why it’s useful
- Provides a minimal, readable reference for regularization concepts used across ML.
- Demonstrates practical steps (prep → train → evaluate → visualize) that transfer to larger projects.
